Place your CV as a PDF at `public/resume.pdf`.

When present, the site will serve it at `/resume.pdf` and the "Download CV" button will download your file.

If you don't add a file, the button will attempt to provide a small sample PDF as a fallback.

Replace this file with your actual `resume.pdf` to use your real CV.
